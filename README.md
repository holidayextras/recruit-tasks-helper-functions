# Helper Functions Task (v0.0.1)

## Installation

We've tried to keep this as simple as possible to set up:
 - Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 - Navigate to the directory containing this project in your terminal.
 - Type `npm install`.
 - Run the tests with `npm run test` (you can use this to verify changes you're making aren't breaking things).

## The task

Your mission is to refactor the code in `helpers.js` for the better as much as possible.
You may want to consider the following:

  - Code repetition
  - Code clarity
  - Testability
  - Ways in which this code could fail that might not have been considered.

Some things you might like to know:

  - Anything assigned to `module.exports` in `helpers.js` will be publicly available when this module is used in other projects.
  - Functions starting with an `_` will be considered private, even when available via module.exports.
  - Check out https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/ for any help with "falsy" values if you're not familiar with JS.
  - Some of the functions further down in the task get pretty complex, this is intentional, try your best.
  - There's nothing to say you can't completely change the `helpers.js` file, do what you think works best given the considerations above.

Good luck, if you have any questions on the task, feel free to raise an issue on our github page at: https://github.com/holidayextras/recruit-tasks-helper-functions . We won't give pointers on improving the code, but we will assist with understanding the existing code and clarifying any of the requirements where possible.
