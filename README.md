# Helper Functions Task (v0.0.1)

## Installation

We've tried to keep this as simple as possible to set up:
 - Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 - Navigate to the directory containing this project in your terminal.
 - Type `npm install`.
 - Run the tests with `npm run test` (you can use this to verify changes you're making aren't breaking things).

## The task

Your mission is to refactor this code for the better as much as possible.
You may want to consider the following:

  - Code repetition
  - Code clarity
  - Testability
  - Ways in which this code could fail.

Some things you might like to know:

  - Anything assigned to module.exports will be publicly available when
    this module is used in other projects.
  - Functions starting with an "_" will be considered private, even
    when available via module.exports.
  - Check out https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/ for
    any help with "falsy" values if you're not familiar with JS.
  - Some of the functions further down get pretty complex, try your
    best and ask us at ...github url here... if you're having issues
    understanding the existing bad implementations.

Good luck!
