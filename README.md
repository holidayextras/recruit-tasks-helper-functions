# Helper Functions Task (v0.0.1)

## Installation

We've tried to keep this as simple as possible to set up:
 - Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
 - Navigate to the directory containing this project in your terminal.
 - Type `npm install`.
 - Run the tests with `npm run test` (you can use this to verify changes you're making aren't breaking things).

## The task

Your mission is to refactor the code in `helpers.js` for the better as much as possible.
You may want to consider the following:

  - Code repetition
  - Code clarity
  - Testability
  - Ways in which this code could fail that might not have been considered.

Some things you might like to know:

  - Anything assigned to module.exports will be publicly available when
    this module is used in other projects.
  - Functions starting with an "_" will be considered private, even
    when available via module.exports.
  - Check out https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/ for
    any help with "falsy" values if you're not familiar with JS.
  - Some of the functions further down get pretty complex, try your
    best and ask us at ...github url here... if you're having issues
    understanding the existing bad implementations.

Good luck, if you have any questions on the task, feel free to raise an issue on our github page at: https://github.com/holidayextras/recruit-tasks-helper-functions
